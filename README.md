# DriverPass Projects Reflection

## DriverPass Project Summary
DriverPass is a company that helps people get ready for their driving tests. They needed a computer system where people could take practice tests, book driving lessons, and keep track of their appointments. They wanted it to work on phones and computers, even if the internet wasn't working sometimes. Our job was to make a system that did all that easily.

## What I Did Well
I did a really good job of figuring out what the system needed to do and writing it all down clearly. I made sure to write down all the things the system had to do and also all the important things, like how fast it needed to be. I also made diagrams that showed how the system would work, and that made it easier for the people who would build the system to do their jobs.

## What I Would Revise
If I could do one thing over, it would be the first paper where I wrote down all the things the system needed to do. It had all the right information, but I would make the words even simpler so everyone could understand it, even people who don't know much about computers. That way, the people at DriverPass would understand the plan for the system better.

## Figuring Out and Doing What Users Needed
To know what DriverPass needed, I read through the interview and the things they wanted to do. I figured out all the things the system needed to do, like booking lessons, and things that made the system work well, like being secure and fast. It's really important to know what people need so that the system is easy to use and does what they want it to do.

## How I Plan Software and What I’ll Do Next Time
When I make software, I start by really understanding what the problem is and what the people who will use it need. I make pictures (diagrams) to show how things will work, I write down everything the system needs to do, and I test things many times to make the system better. Next time, I will get more feedback from the users while I'm planning, and I’ll try to be flexible, so I can make changes if the users’ needs change.
